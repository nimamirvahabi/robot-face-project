# ROBOT face project
-------------------
this project is about a robot called ecld-9 that like talking but he dont know anything about any language. You can learn some words to him.
before meeting him you should write a list about four words that you want to learn him. but he isn't intelliget so you can only choose 4 words to make him happy, clam, worried, angry.
but there is another way to talk to him too.
he knows what is distance, so you can give him a sensor and choose sensor mode on app and then you move an object to see what will happen.
you sensor should bo srf-05 or -04. and your board should be arduino uno or mega and you should connect the trig of your sensor to 9 and echo to 10 of arduino. after that you should upload the code to your board .
remember which port are you uploading and then change the code of the app to that port (line 37). and finish.

enjoy ^_^
